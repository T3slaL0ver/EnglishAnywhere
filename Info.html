            <h3 class="info">My name is Stephen Wu and I am a junior at Quince Orchard High School in Gaithersburg, Maryland.</h3>
            <h3 class="info">我的名字是 Stephen Wu，我是馬里蘭州蓋瑟斯堡 Quince Orchard 高中的 11 年級學生。</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="info">Growing up, I spent half of my life in the United States, and the other half in the beautiful island nation of Taiwan. Ever since I was little, my parents insisted that I learn both English and Chinese. At first I was adamantly against this and frequently complained about the extra workload. However as time went by, I started learning of the importance and versatility knowing two of the most commonly spoken languages.</h3>
            <h3 class="info">我成長的過程中，我有一半時間在美國度過，另一半時間在台灣度過。從小，父母就堅持要我學英文和中文。起初我堅決反對這一點，並經常抱怨額外的工作量。然而，隨著時間的过去，我開始了解了解兩種最常用語言的重要性和多功能性。</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="info">As famously said by Edmund de Waal, "With language you are at home anywhere". Being someone who knows both English and Chinese, I was able to effectively be "at home" in any country that spoke English or Chinese. This has allowed me to not only enjoy a seamless transition while travelling, but also enrichen my knowledge of the cultural differences and similarities between the US and Chinese speaking countries such as China or Taiwan.</h3>
            <h3 class="info">正如埃德蒙·德瓦爾 (Edmund de Waal) 的名言，“有了語言，您就在任何地方”。作為一個既懂英文又懂中文的人，我能夠在任何說英文或中文的國家有“在家”的感覺。這讓我不僅在旅行中享受了無縫過渡，還豐富了我對美國和中國或台灣等中文國家之間的文化差異和相似之處的了解。</h3>
            <br>
            <h3 class="info">I created this website with the intention of teaching Chinese-speaking people English on a free, readily available web page that can be accessed anywhere. This website contains everything one will need to learn a language, including an intricately designed curriculum, audio recordings, sample sentences, and quizzes to serve as a check for understanding after each unit. It is my greatest hope that through this website, more Chinese speaking people can easily learn English and enjoy the benefits of being bilingual without having to pay high amounts of money for a tutor or travel out of their homes to tutoring centers or schools.</h3>
            <h3 class="info">我創建這個網站的目的是在一個可以在任何地方訪問的免費、隨時可用的網頁上教講中文的人英語。該網站包含學習一門語言所需的一切，包括精心設計的課程、錄音、例句和考試。我最大的希望是透過這個網站讓更多說中文的人可以輕鬆地學習英語，享受雙語帶來的好處，而不必支付高額的學費，也不必出門去補習班或學校。</h3>
